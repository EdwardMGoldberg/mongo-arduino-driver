I have taken on the challenge of developing a Driver for the Arduino
Library.  For people that have not heard about the Arduino this is a
small "System On Chip" ( SOC ) based computer for about $30.00 that
runs on very low power.

Examples of Arduino use are:

1) Robots that can navigate
2) Very light computers for Lighter Than Aircraft
3) Remote data Acquisition Nodes
4) Remote Control System.

When you add an Ethernet Chip the cost of the system is still under
$50.00 for each node.

If you have any ideas or projects with the Arduino and MongoDB.  I
would like to collect all of this work into a Driver for MongoDB.

I have submitted for a talk at MongoSV on the topic:  "Arduino MongoDB
Driver".

MongoDB is a great fit for logging data and remote data systems.  I
look forward to your inputs.
